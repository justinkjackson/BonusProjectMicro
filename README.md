# BonusProjectMicro
This is a bonus project that I did for Microporcessors at Mississippi State Fall 2018
This project utilized C and C++ languages to create a state machine that mimics the actions of a locking mechanism using servo motors using a 4 digit PIN code. The code checks for each digit and if one digit is incorrect the lock will reset to the original state. The code steps through the states until the correct pin is fully entered.
